            Mirema. I am a novice software developer at Moringa School, learning
            how to code, with a strong focus on front-end development and styling.

          <h2>Formula One</h2>
          <p>
            In Formula One, I passionately support Ferrari.
            The blend of cutting-edge technology, high-speed thrills,
             and tactical brilliance keeps me on the edge of my seat.

          <p>
            My favorite driver, Lewis Hamilton, who recently joined Ferrari,
            is a true icon. His achievements and determination inspire me to
            push the limits in my own pursuits.
